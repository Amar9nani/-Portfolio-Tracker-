## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Recharts
- **Backend**: Express.js, Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Development Tools**: pgAdmin

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) 
- Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DenizSungurtekin/Investment-Portfolio-Tracker
cd investment-portfolio-tracker
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
```env
POSTGRES_USER=yourname
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourdbpassword
POSTGRES_DB=investments
PGADMIN_EMAIL=your.email@example.com
PGADMIN_PASSWORD=yourdbpassword
```

3. Start the application using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Go to http://localhost:5173/ And Enjoy !

## Update

1. Pull the repository:
```bash
git pull
docker-compose up --build
```
### Use the application

On http://localhost:5173/, you‚Äôll find dashboards displaying a dataset named "investments (fake)." This dataset is initialized when Docker starts and is linked to a table called "investments_fake" in the PostgreSQL database. This view allows you to work with the application without affecting your actual data.

Switch to the "investment" view to analyze your personal investments. To add records of your investments, use the add button (the "+" symbol).

![Demo](./img/demo1.png)

For the first month, you'll need to enter each entry manually. At the beginning of each subsequent month, the process simplifies: you only need to enter one investment manually, which will trigger the system to shift to the current month. After that, instead of entering each investment individually, you can copy entries from the previous month to the current one by clicking the green copy button and adjust the amounts as needed, making it quick to update your records for the new month.

The records will be stored in a table named "investments" in the postgres database which is fully secured and hosted in local

Do not hesitate to make back up of your investments table !

(Potential Implementation of button which can do the backup automatically)
### Dev commands
If you want to rerun clean (for dev purpose) It will refactor all your docker be careful. Adjust the prune command at will:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker system prune -a --volumes -f
docker-compose up --build
```
## Services

The application runs three main services:

- **Frontend + Backend**: Running on `http://localhost:5173`
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Running on `localhost:5432`
- **pgAdmin**: Available at `http://localhost:5050`

## Development

### Database Management

- Access pgAdmin at `http://localhost:5050`
- Login using credentials from `.env`
- Connect to database using:
  - Host: `postgres`
  - Port: `5432`
  - Username: from `.env`
  - Password: from `.env`

## API Endpoints

### Investments

- `GET /api/investments/:tableName` - Get all investments
- `POST /api/investments/:tableName` - Create new investment
- `PUT /api/investments/:tableName/:id` - Update investment
- `DELETE /api/investments/:tableName/:id` - Delete investment

## Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| POSTGRES_USER | Database username | - |
| POSTGRES_PASSWORD | Database password | - |
| POSTGRES_DB | Database name | investments |
| PGADMIN_EMAIL | pgAdmin login email | - |
| PGADMIN_PASSWORD | pgAdmin login password | - |

## Troubleshooting

1. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL container is running: `docker ps`
   - Check logs: `docker logs postgres_db`
   - Verify environment variables in `.env`

2. **Container Issues**
   - Rebuild containers: `docker-compose up --build`
   - Clean up: `docker-compose down -v`
